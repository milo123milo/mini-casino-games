# Project Overview

## Introduction

This project is a casino games application built using SquareLine Studio and LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library). It includes three classic casino games: Slots, Dice Roll, and Blackjack, each with their own unique gameplay mechanics, animations, and sound effects. The application is designed to run on ESP32 hardware using the Arduino framework.

## Directory Structure

The project follows this general directory structure:

```

```

## Main Components

The application consists of several main components:

1. **UI System**: Built with LVGL, includes screens, buttons, animations, and other interface elements.

2. **Game Logic**: Each game has its own implementation in the `games/` directory:
   - `games/blackjack/`: Card game logic, dealing, and scoring
   - `games/dices/`: Dice roll mechanics and outcome determination
   - `games/slots/`: Slot machine reels, randomization, and win detection

3. **Store System**: Manages in-game currency, betting, and winnings.

4. **Animation System**: Provides smooth animations for game elements, including:
   - Card flipping and dealing
   - Dice rolling
   - Slot reel spinning
   - Win/loss notifications

5. **Audio System**: Manages sound effects and background music for each game.

## Key Files

- `Casino_Games.ino`: Main Arduino sketch file with setup() and loop() functions
- `ui.c/h`: Main UI components generated by SquareLine Studio
- `ui_events.c/h`: Event handlers for UI interactions
- `store/store.c/h`: Implementation of the money and betting system
- `mp3_player.c/h`: Audio playback functionality
- `games/*/`: Game-specific logic and mechanics

## Flow of Execution

1. The Arduino `setup()` function initializes hardware components and the LVGL library
2. The UI components are initialized through `ui_init()`
3. The home screen displays the available games
4. The Arduino `loop()` function continuously calls `lv_timer_handler()` to process LVGL tasks
5. Event handlers in `ui_events.c` process user interactions
6. Game logic is invoked based on user actions
7. The store system tracks and updates the player's balance
8. Animations and sound effects enhance the user experience

## Development Environment

The project is built using the Arduino IDE with the ESP32 board package (version 2.0.11). The main components are:

- **Arduino IDE**: The development environment for building and uploading code
- **ESP32 Board Package**: Provides ESP32 hardware support for Arduino
- **LVGL Library**: Graphics library for UI rendering
- **TFT_eSPI**: Display driver library for communicating with the screen
- **SquareLine Studio**: UI design tool that generates LVGL code

## Technologies Used

- **Arduino Framework**: Provides the programming interface and hardware abstraction
- **LVGL**: Open-source graphics library for creating embedded GUIs
- **SquareLine Studio**: UI design tool for LVGL
- **C/C++ Language**: Core programming language used throughout the project
- **ESP32**: Target hardware platform

## Hardware Integration

The application is designed to work with:

1. **Display**: TFT LCD display (typically 320x240 or higher resolution)
2. **Touch Interface**: Touchscreen input for user interactions
3. **Audio Output**: Optional MP3/audio playback for sound effects
4. **ESP32 Microcontroller**: Provides the processing power and memory

## Design Patterns

The codebase follows several design patterns:

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: UI interactions trigger event callbacks
2. **State Machines**: Games use state machines to manage gameplay flow
3. **Component-Based Design**: Separating UI, logic, and resource management
